There are some limitations of our research. First, we just used two stocks to make portfolio. It would be better to build portfolio with various industry sectors. Second, we assumed that we can buy and sell stocks in non-integer form, which makes our model unrealistic. Third, we defined the state only using the stock price, and we showed that it is hard to predict the stock price tendency by this way. Hence, for better portfolio model using stocks as assets, state should include environmental factors such as market sentiment, average stock price of each industry sector. Or building portfolio model using various types of assets such as stocks, bonds, ETF funds considering the inflation, employment rate, market indexes would be better to derive more interesting conclusion.
