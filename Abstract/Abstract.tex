In this project, we use Q-learning and deep Q-network to train agents that manage a stock portfolio of two stocks. We defined a state as the stock price change history, and an action as the weight between two stocks, and a reward as portfolio value change or sharpe ratio. In most cases Q-table or neural networks performed better than the 50-50 reevaluate benchmark when we trained, but when we use Q-table and neural networks to test on unknown datasets, they are not good as the benchmark.
